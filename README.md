### First steps
To use the insignia editor, you have to go to setup first. Here you've to configure the directory paths - this should me self explanatory. After this you have to create an Backup of the files which could be edited with this tool. Just press the backup button. (the recovery doesn't work yet - just copy the backuped files to the origin if you want to recover your files)

### Future steps

- Recovery function
- Import function for new graphics to use for an insignia
- optimize XAML
- optimize the open points (see preprocessor instructions)
